# MongoDB $in Operator with Empty Array

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error related to using the `$in` operator with an empty array in MongoDB queries.  The issue arises because an empty array with `$in` returns no results, even if the field exists.  The solution provides an alternative approach to handle this situation.

## Bug Description

The incorrect usage of the `$in` operator with an empty array results in no documents being returned, even if the targeted field is present in the documents.

## Solution

To correctly handle cases where a field might not exist or has an empty array as its value, it is recommended to use alternative approaches such as checking for the existence of the field using `$exists`.
